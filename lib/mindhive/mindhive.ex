    Auth appears to be handled by https://share.mindhive.org/rest-auth/login/ (and the api appears to be hosted at share.mindhive.org).
    I am unable to auth currently with this method but can cover api calls by injecting the correct auth token.
    Need to determine if there is an account flag or other attribute missing.

    Need to discuss how to handle user management between systems.
